Part 1

1. Using C# IDE, create a program that implements an abstract class called Animal.
  This class has the properties: Name, Colour and Age.
  The class has the following methods:
o Getter methods
o Setters methods
o A method called Eat that is an abstract method of type void.
2. Create a Dog class that implements the Animal class and the Eat method that prints “Dogs
eat meat.”
3. Create a Cat class that implements the above Animal class and the Eat method that prints
“Cats eat mice.”
4. To test the program, ask the user for a dog name and create a new Dog type object from
the Main of the program. Give the Dog object a name, colour and age, and then execute
the getter methods to print these properties and the Eat methods.
5. Repeat the previous step for a Cat object.

   
Part 2

1. Using C# IDE, create a program that implements an IAnimal interface.
  The interface has the properties: Name, Colour, Height and Age.
  The interface has the following methods:
o Getters methods
o Setters methods
o A method called “Eat”
o A method called “Cry”
  The Eat method is an abstract method of type void. The Cry method is a method of
type string.
2. Create a Dog class that implements the IAnimal interface. The Eat method should print
“Dogs eat meat” and the “Cry” method should print “Woof!”
3. Create a Cat class that implements the above IAnimal interface. The Eat method should
print “Cats eat mice” and the “Cry” method should print “Meow!”
4. To test the program, ask the user for a dog name and create a new Dog type object from
the Main of the program. Then ask the user to give the Dog object a name, height, colour
and age, and then execute the getter methods to print these properties and run the Eat and
Cry methods.
5. Repeat the previous step for a Cat object.
6. Create a list called “animals” and add some animal objects to the list.
7. Print the names of all the animals.
